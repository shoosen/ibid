.TH IBID-PLUGIN "1" "March 2010" "Ibid 0.1" "Ibid - Multi-protocol Bot"
.SH NAME
ibid-plugin \- Plugin testing developer environment for Ibid
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ibid-plugin
.RI [ options ...]
.RI [ plugin\fR[\fB- ]| plugin\fB.\fIProcessor [\fB-\fR]...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility is for testing Ibid plugins without the full bot
environment.
This means testing can be performed offline and without loading all the
available plugins.
.P
This should be run in a configured Ibid bot directory.
.P
All the listed plugins and Processors will be loaded on start-up.
Naming a plugin loads the complete plugin.
Suffixing a \fB-\fR to the name, ignores that plugin or Processor
instead of loading it.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-configured\fR
Load all configured plugins, instead of only the core and requested
plugins.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-only\fR
Don't load the Ibid core plugins, only the plugins requested.
Note that without the \fBcore\fR plugin to pre- and post-process events,
most other plugins won't function correctly.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-public\fR
By default, \fBibid-plugin\fR emulates a private conversation with the
bot.
With this option, the conversation is considered to be public and the
bot will have to be addressed to provoke a response.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Increase verbosity.
The final form of each \fIEvent\fR object will be displayed before any responses.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show a help message and exit.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I ibid.ini
Locates the database to act upon by looking for the \fB[databases].ibid\fR value
in the bot configuration file in the current directory.
.SH BUGS
\fBibid-plugin\fR doesn't emulate a complete Ibid environment, and will
ignore all of the following:
.TP
*
Delayed and periodically executed functions.
.TP
*
Messages to alternate sources.
.TP
*
Messages directly dispatched, rather than added to responses.
.TP
*
Permissions.
All permissions are granted to the user.
