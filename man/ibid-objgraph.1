.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility is for graphing object-type usage from an Ibid bot
configured to log such usage.
.P
Matplotlib is required for graphing.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-e\fR \fITIME\fR, \fB\-\-examine\fR=\fITIME\fR
Examine the object usage at time \fITIME\fR, and print a sorted list of type
statistics at that time.
This function can be useful in determining which types to graph, when chasing
down a detected leak.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fIFILE\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Output to \fIFILE\fR instead of displaying interactive graph GUI.
\fIFILE\fR can be any format supported by Matplotlib, detected by the file
extension.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR \fIDPI\fR, \fB\-\-dpi\fR=\fIDPI\fR
When outputting in raster formats, use \fIDPI\fR output DPI.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show a help message and exit.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I logfile
A log file generated by loading the \fBmemory\fR plugin into Ibid, which will
periodically log object usage.
It can be gzip compressed, if the filename ends in \fB.gz\fR.
