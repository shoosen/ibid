Introduction
============

This is the documentation for Ibid.
Ibid is a multi-protocol general purpose chat bot written in Python.
It uses a natural language interface, and can connect to multiple sources
including IRC, Jabber and SILC servers, as well as allowing interaction using
SMTP, HTTP and various RPC protocols.
It aims to be a useful base to build any kind of chat bot from, and to make
plugins and extensions as easy as possible to write.

Ibid is in constant development.
The code is hosted `on Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/ibid/>`_.

The most recent version of this documentation is available at
`http://ibid.omnia.za.net/docs/ <http://ibid.omnia.za.net/docs/>`_.
